Simulation of electrical commerce project, now in java.
The main toll on the original simulation was creating the edges that are added to the graph every round. They are created and uploaded to a "additions" file.
Other than that, you may use the java version to simulate the scores per each influencer group.
There can be more than one group in the influencer file.
You should configure the file name and iteration run number for your own liking
