This file is dedicated for the additions.
Each run of the simulation uses one addition.
Usually they are created mid simulation run. However, it takes a great toll over the simulation run time.
When trying to find the mean value for a influencer group, you should aim for a large amount of addition files for a more proper outcome.
You can create more addition files using the python and batch script. Notice: it takes a great deal of time per each iteration.
